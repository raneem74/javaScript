        BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan),
         also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band that formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.
         The septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own material. 
         Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres; their lyrics often discuss mental health, 
         the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, and individualism. Their work also frequently references literature,
          philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate universe storyline.

After launching in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS released their first Korean-language studio album, Dark & Wild, 
and Japanese-language studio album, Wake Up, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, 
Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed i
nto the global music market, leading the Korean wave into the United States and breaking sales records. They became the first Korean ensemble to receive a Gold 
certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop", as well as the first act from South Korea to top the Billboard 
200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018). BTS became one of the few groups since the Beatles (1966–68) to chart four US number-one albums in less than 
two years, and Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number o
ne on the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single "Dynamite". Their follow-up songs "Savage Love", "Life Goes On", "Butter", and "Permissi
on to Dance" made them the quickest act to earn four US number-one singles since Justin Timberlake in 2006.

As of 2022, according to the Circle Chart, BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history, having sold in excess of 30 million albums. Their studio album Map of the Soul: 7 (2020) is the best-selling album of all time in South Korea. They are the first non-English-speaking and Asian act to sell out concerts at Wembley Stadium and the Rose Bowl (Love Yourself World Tour in 2019), and were named the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's (IFPI) Global Recording Artist of the Year in 2020 and 2021. The group's accolades include multiple American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, Golden Disc Awards, and nominations for five Grammy Awards. Outside of music, they have addressed three sessions of the United Nations General Assembly and partnered with UNICEF in 2017 to establish the Love Myself anti-violence campaign. Featured on Time's international cover as "Next Generation Leaders" and dubbed the "Princes of Pop", BTS has also appeared on Time's lists of the 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) and the 100 most influential people in the world (2019), and in 2018 became the youngest recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit from the President of South Korea for their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language. Beginning in late 2022, the group will take a hiatus to complete their required military service, with a reunion planned for 2025.
